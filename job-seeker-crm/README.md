# Job Seeker CRM

This Angular 18 application provides a lightweight CRM for managing job seekers, running outreach campaigns and coordinating multi-channel communication.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app uses Angular's in-memory web API to mock data for job seekers, campaigns and communication events.

## Project structure

```
src/app/
  modules/
    job-seekers/
    campaigns/
    communication/

```

Each feature module encapsulates its components and leverages shared Angular Material UI components.
